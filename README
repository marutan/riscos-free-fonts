Core RISC OS free fonts
-----------------------

This is a collection of fonts from the operating system RISC OS,
originally produced by Acorn Computers.

It contains fonts that are metric compatible with the Postscript Level 1
core fonts/PDF core fonts. It also contains several other miscellaneous
fonts.

Please note, I am not a font expert and there may well have been
mistakes made during the conversion process. However I hope they may be
useful for people and could be developed further.

Conversion Process
------------------

The fonts are converted using Fontforge's 'acorn2sfd'. They were then
post processed to remove broken winding rules, and broken hinting.
The scripts used to generate these fonts are located in the Tools
directory.

Four oblique fonts (Corpus Medium Oblique, Corpus Bold Oblique, Homerton
Medium Oblique, Homerton Bold Oblique) could not be automatically
converted with acorn2sfd as they are in a different font format that
it did not understand.

Sassoon Primary and Sassoon Primary Bold currently have the wrong font
encoding due to a segfault with acorn2sfd when using the Base0 encoding.
